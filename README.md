# TF2-Demo-Archiver
_____________________________________________
Like the name implies - this is a script to archive your created demos.
You save around 40% of space. (Or at least I do)
Should work with both demos created by P-Rec and Demos created by the integrated feature of TF2.

Note: This is really old code, so it isn't the best syntax-wise but it works, if you have a problem feel free to create an issue

## Installation
_____________________________________________

* Download this as zip and extract it in the folder where you want it to be
* Get Python (3.X)
* Execute the file with `python main.py` (in the console with the folder where main.py resides as working directory - to simplify this just create a `run.bat` in the directory with the same content)
* Check if you get a module error (like: `ImportError: No module named '<module name>'`) if so then open console and type `python -m pip install <module name>`
* Enjoy
